I am writing to provide you with the results of the recent implementation of the ACR in the Deir Ashayer Micro_DMR507U. Specifically, we converted two monopole antennas to two directional antennas on July 19, 2023. Our analysis took into account the three days before and after the ACR.

Based on the analysis result, I recommend the addition of another directional antenna to further enhance coverage in the area. This will not only improve communications capabilities, but also contribute to increased revenue and MTN reputation.
With stable Electricity rationing I also recommend to installation solar system to keep batteries alive for as long as possible which leads to continuously MTN coverage in the area.
